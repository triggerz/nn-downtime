# Description

Christian is a young and ambitious QA employee in your team, who has been trained for approving NCs (Non Conformities) and has been doing so for 2 months. Christian is good at getting acquainted with SOPs, and in this particular case has studied the relevant SOPs. You are involved in the NC, since the production team thinks Christian is inexperienced and blowing the problem out of proportion. On one hand you feel slightly annoyed with the production team, who are undermining Christian's confidence in his new role. On the other hand, you can also see the production team's point about the suggested corrections being rather overdimensioned in this particular case. So what do you do?

# Choice
You fully support Christian. You think the required actions will be hard to implement, but you will  show Christian support and help him to get them done. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -1
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
Supporting your employee is admirable - but not if it isn't in the company's best interests. Christian's suggestion is to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Full support is not the right decision for this dilemma. 

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You take a 1:1 conversation with Christian, followed by a conversation with the production team, where you ask them to suggest alternative actions that can solve the GMP problem. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -2
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
Letting the different parties present their case is always a good idea. However, convening the 1:1s signals that you are the decision maker and that you have to be in the loop. This might not be an effective solution in the long run. 

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You convene a meeting, where everybody can explain their views. Before the meeting, you already know that you will end up supporting the production team. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -3
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
This could be a reasonable way to solve the issue - setting up a meeting and letting the parties find a solution on their own. This supports employees' decision power. However, deciding who'll have your support before the meeting might not be the right thing to do. 

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You let Christian handle this controversy by himself. He has to learn how to handle situations like this, and he can always ask for help.

# Variables
 - Resources: +0
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: -3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
Leaving your employee to resolve his first controversy without your support might not be the best way to solve this issue. Empowerment is good, but managerial feedback and support is very important for personal development. 

# Outcome
X
